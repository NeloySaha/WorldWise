# WorldWise 🌎

WorldWise is a website where you can keep notes about the city or, to keep track of all the places on the world map that you have visited. 🤓 This is a test application running on mock Api. 😉 This project helped me to get familiar with the Context Api, React Query and different usecases of React Router Dom v6 like putting app state in url. 🎉
